Description of Project:

In this project I fine tunned the MobileNet Model to classify hand sign language number (0 to 9) images.

Files and their description:

1) signlanguage.ipynb:

This is the jupyter notebbok code file in which the model is first downloaded, fine tunned and the trained on the sign language images provided in the "Dataset-Compressed.zip" file.

2) Dataset-compressed.zip:

This is the compressed (.zip) file which conatins all the training images for the fine tunned model. This conatins over 200 images for each class of hand sign language numbers.
